    Overview:

        Shader program 'aim_icon':
            Get shader desc: aim_icon_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: aim_icon_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_aim_icon_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_aim_icon_vs_alpha = 1
                Uniform block 'aim_icon_vs_params':
                    C struct: aim_icon_vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_aim_icon_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: aim_icon_fs
                Uniform block 'aim_icon_fs_params':
                    C struct: aim_icon_fs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_aim_icon_fs_params = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader aim_icon = sg_make_shader(aim_icon_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'aim_icon_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_aim_icon_vs_position] = { ... },

                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'aim_icon_vs_params':

        aim_icon_vs_params_t aim_icon_vs_params = {
            .mvp_mat = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_aim_icon_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(aim_icon_vs_params));

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'aim_icon_fs_params':

        aim_icon_fs_params_t aim_icon_fs_params = {
            .color = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_aim_icon_fs_params, &SG_RANGE(aim_icon_fs_params));
