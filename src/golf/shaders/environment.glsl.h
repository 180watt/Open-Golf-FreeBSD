    Overview:

        Shader program 'environment':
            Get shader desc: environment_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: environment_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_environment_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_environment_vs_texturecoord = 1
                    ATTR_environment_vs_normal = 2
                Uniform block 'environment_vs_params':
                    C struct: environment_vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_environment_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: environment_fs
                Image 'kd_texture':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_kd_texture = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader environment = sg_make_shader(environment_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'environment_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_environment_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_environment_vs_texturecoord] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_environment_vs_normal] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_kd_texture = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'environment_vs_params':

        environment_vs_params_t environment_vs_params = {
            .model_mat = ...;
            .proj_view_mat = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_environment_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(environment_vs_params));
