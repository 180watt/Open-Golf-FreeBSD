    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader ball = sg_make_shader(ball_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'ball_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {

                },
            },

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_ball_normal_map = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'ball_vs_params':

        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_ball_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(ball_vs_params));

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'ball_fs_params':

        ball_fs_params_t ball_fs_params = {
            .color = ...;
        };
