    Overview:

        Shader program 'ui':
            Get shader desc: ui_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: ui_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_ui_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_ui_vs_texture_coord = 1
                Uniform block 'ui_vs_params':
                    C struct: ui_vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_ui_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: ui_fs
                Uniform block 'ui_fs_params':
                    C struct: ui_fs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_ui_fs_params = 0
                Image 'ui_texture':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_ui_texture = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader ui = sg_make_shader(ui_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'ui_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_ui_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_ui_vs_texture_coord] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_ui_texture = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'ui_vs_params':

        ui_vs_params_t ui_vs_params = {
            .mvp_mat = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_ui_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(ui_vs_params));

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'ui_fs_params':

        ui_fs_params_t ui_fs_params = {
            .color = ...;
            .tex_x = ...;
            .tex_y = ...;
            .tex_dx = ...;
            .tex_dy = ...;
            .is_font = ...;
        };
